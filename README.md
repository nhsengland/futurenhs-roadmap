# FutureNHS Roadmap
In this repository sits the [official FutureNHS public product roadmap](https://github.com/nhsengland/futurenhs-roadmap/projects/1). We have also created a [Coming Next](/functions.md) page to give you a view function by function about what we have released and what is coming next

Our product roadmap is one of the ways in which we want to show you what we're up to. You can view it to get an idea of the things currently in progress, things about to be released and ideas we have planned for the future.

Your feedback is crucial in helping us prioritise product development so don't be afraid to leave a comment or ask a question on anything you may be interested in.

Our roadmap will be constantly evolving to meet the ever changing priorities of our platform users so make sure you come back to see what's changed.

## Guide to the roadmap

### Items
We are using Github issues to record items on the roadmap that we are working on. Each item includes a **summary**, an **intended outcome** and a description of **how it work**. As the items move through the roadmap these will evolve over times.

**Milestones** are used to indicate a release in which it is intended the item will be available to use to all platform members although we will be testing these in advance with users. We will focus on an agile delivery, with the intention of releasing new functionality every sprint. We will however have some major milestones to aim for and will label these accordingingly.

We use **labels** to indicate to which function the feature we are developing belongs. This lets users drill down into specific functions to understand how they will be developed over the coming months.

### Timescales

The roadmap is split into three timescale blocks:
- Short term (0-3 months)
- Medium term (3-9 months)
- Long term (9-12 months)

The timescale in which an item sits indicates when we plan to have a item ready for users.

Another **Ideas** column is used to display ideas we have thought about but not yet fully started exploring.
