# FutureNHS Roadmap
In this repository sits the [official FutureNHS public product roadmap](https://github.com/nhsengland/futurenhs-roadmap/projects/1).

Our product roadmap is one of the ways in which we want to show you what we're up to. You can view it to get an idea of the things currently in progress, things about to be released and ideas we have planned for the future.

Your feedback is crucial in helping us prioritise product development so don't be afraid to leave a comment or ask a question on anything you may be interested in. You can do this easily by creating a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

Our roadmap will be constantly evolving to meet the ever changing priorities of our platform users so make sure you come back to see what's changed.

## Guide to the roadmap

### Items
We are using Github issues to record items on the roadmap that we are working on. Each item includes a **summary**, an **intended outcome** and a description of **how it work**. As the items move through the roadmap these will evolve over times.

We use **labels** to indicate to which function the feature we are developing belongs. This lets users drill down into specific functions to understand how they will be developed over the coming months.

### Timescales

The roadmap is split into three timescale blocks:
#### Building now 
- Expected release within the next 3 to 6 weeks
- We're actively buidling these in the current sprint so release is imminent. We'll update this column every three weeks after each Sprint.

#### Buiding next - Solution identified
- Expected release from 6 weeks to 3 months
- These are ready to be allocated to a sprint for building as soon as they reach the top of the priority list

#### Identifying solution
- Expected release from 3 months to 9 months
- We've identified the problem and are working on a solution to fix it. Release will depend on complexity of problem and priority.

#### Thinking about
- No expected release date
- These are things that have been raised but we still need to full understand the problem before we start working on them
